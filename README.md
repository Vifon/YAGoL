**Yet Another Game of Life**

A toy project from a few years ago that I used for testing a few
things out.

In some places things are not as consistent as I'd like them to be,
and the event system is a giant hack. The whole thing is
overcomplicated but it kind of was the point of it. Nonetheless, it
has served its purpose.
